There are three QA focus areas in Omnivore:

1. Saving
2. Library Management
3. Reader Controls


## Saving

Omnivore has three APIs involved in saving that should all be tested. URLs, Files, and Pages (captured content from the browser or the mobile) app can all be saved

## Library Management

The main library in `/home` has functionality for searching and organizing content. 


## Reader functionality

The reader has functionality for highlighting, annotating, and saving reading progress
