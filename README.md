## Shoutouts :tada:

Omnivore takes advantage of some great open source software:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Most of our backend and frontend are written in TypeScript.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Our frontend is a Next.JS app and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - We do all our data fetching on the web using SWR.
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - We use Stitches on the frontend to style our components.
- [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) - We use Mozilla's Readability library to make pages easier to read.
- [Swift GraphQL](https://www.swift-graphql.com/) - We generate our GraphQL queries on iOS using Swift GraphQL.
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) - We generate our GraphQL queries on Android using Apollo GraphQL.
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - We use Radix UI's components on our frontend.
- [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) - PDF.js is used to have open source pdf functionality. 
- And many more awesome libraries, just checkout our package files to see what we are using.

## Importing Libraries

Check out our [docs](https://docs.omnivore.app/using/importing.html) for information on importing your data from other apps.

## How to setup local development :computer:

The easiest way to get started with local development is to use `docker compose up`. This will start a postgres container, our web frontend, an API server, and our content fetching microservice.

### Requirements for development

Omnivore is written in TypeScript and JavaScript.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.16) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) -- Versions are managed by [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started).
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) -- See below for installation info.

### Running the web and API services

#### 1. Start docker compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore
cd omnivore
docker compose up
```

This will start postgres, initialize the database, and start the web and api services.

#### 2. Open the browser

Open <http://localhost:3000> and confirm Omnivore is running

#### 3. Login with the test account

During database setup docker compose creates an account `demo@omnivore.app`, password: `demo_password`.

Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser and choose `Continue with Email` to login.

### Frontend Development

If you want to work on just the frontend of Omnivore you can run the backend services
with docker compose and the frontend locally:

```bash
docker compose up api content-fetch
cd packages/web
cp .env.template .env.local
yarn dev
```

You will need to configure some values in the new `.env.local` file. These are
the values for running the `web` service directly on your host machine and
running `api` and `content-fetch` within docker:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIGHLIGHTS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Running the puppeteer-parse service outside of Docker

To save pages you need to run the `puppeteer-parse` service.

#### 1. Install and configure Chromium

```bash
brew install chromium --no-quarantine
export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
export CHROMIUM_PATH=`which chromium`
```

#### 2. Navigate to the service directory, setup your env file, and install dependencies

```bash
cd packages/puppeteer-parse
cp .env.example .env
yarn
```

#### 3. Start the service

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the puppeteer-parse service on port 9090.

In your browser go to <http://localhost:3000/home>, click the `Add Link` button,
and enter a URL such as `https://blog.omnivore.app/p/getting-started-with-omnivore`.

You should see a Chromium window open and navigate to your link. When the service
is done fetching your content you will see it in your library.
