# Development vs Production Deployment Strategy

## Current Issue Analysis

The Redis connection errors (`connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379`) occurred because we were running **production compiled code** with **development environment variables** and **development expectations**.

### Root Cause

- **Current Setup**: Docker images are built for production (compiled JavaScript)
- **Override Issue**: docker-compose.override.yml was trying to run development commands on production images
- **Mixed Environment**: Production containers with development configurations

## üîß Development Setup (Current)

### What We Have Now

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml - Development overrides
services:
  api:
    command: yarn workspace @omnivore/api start # Production command
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development # Development environment
    volumes:
      - ./packages/api:/app/packages/api # Code mounting
```

### Issues with Current Approach

1. **No Hot Reload**: Changes require container rebuild
2. **Production Code**: Running compiled JS instead of TypeScript
3. **Dev Dependencies Missing**: ts-node-dev not available in production image
4. **Redis Connection Issues**: Compiled code may have cached connection logic

## üöÄ Proper Development Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Development Dockerfile

Create `packages/api/Dockerfile.dev`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.12-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install all dependencies including dev dependencies
COPY package.json yarn.lock tsconfig.json ./
COPY packages/api/package.json ./packages/api/
RUN yarn install

# Copy source code
COPY packages/api ./packages/api

# Use development command
CMD ["yarn", "workspace", "@omnivore/api", "dev"]
```

### Option 2: Local Development (No Docker)

```bash
# Run services locally for development
yarn workspace @omnivore/api dev          # API with hot reload
yarn workspace @omnivore/web dev          # Web with hot reload
yarn workspace @omnivore/content-fetch dev # Content fetch with hot reload
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

- **Infrastructure**: Redis, PostgreSQL, MinIO in Docker
- **Application**: Run locally with hot reload
- **Benefits**: Fast development, proper TypeScript support

## üè≠ Production Deployment Strategy

### Self-Hosting (Docker Compose)

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    image: omnivore-api:latest
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      - PG_HOST=postgres
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    restart: unless-stopped

  web:
    image: omnivore-web:latest
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    depends_on:
      - api
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Cloud Deployment (Kubernetes/Cloud Run)

```yaml
# k8s/api-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: omnivore-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: omnivore-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: omnivore-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: omnivore-api:latest
          env:
            - name: NODE_ENV
              value: 'production'
            - name: REDIS_URL
              value: 'redis://redis-service:6379'
            - name: PG_HOST
              value: 'postgres-service'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

## üìã Environment Configuration

### Development Environment Variables

```env
# .env.development
NODE_ENV=development
API_ENV=local
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PG_HOST=localhost
PG_PORT=5432
LOG_LEVEL=debug
HOT_RELOAD=true
```

### Production Environment Variables

```env
# .env.production
NODE_ENV=production
API_ENV=production
REDIS_URL=redis://redis-cluster:6379
PG_HOST=postgres-primary
PG_PORT=5432
LOG_LEVEL=info
SENTRY_DSN=https://...
```

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Current Development (Immediate)

1. ‚úÖ Use production Docker images with proper environment variables
2. ‚úÖ Fix Redis connection issues in source code
3. ‚úÖ Ensure all services work with current setup

### Phase 2: Proper Development Setup (Short-term)

1. Create development Dockerfiles with dev dependencies
2. Implement hot reload for development
3. Separate development vs production configurations

### Phase 3: Production Optimization (Long-term)

1. Multi-stage Docker builds
2. Health checks and monitoring
3. Horizontal scaling capabilities
4. CI/CD pipeline integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Actions

### For Development

```bash
# Create development environment
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.dev.yml
# Edit docker-compose.dev.yml to use development Dockerfiles
# Set proper development environment variables
```

### For Production

```bash
# Create production environment
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.prod.yml
# Remove development overrides
# Add production optimizations (health checks, restart policies)
# Configure external services (managed Redis, PostgreSQL)
```

### For Self-Hosting

```bash
# Use the current setup with improvements
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Development

- **Pros**: Fast iteration, debugging capabilities
- **Cons**: Resource intensive, not production-like

### Production

- **Pros**: Optimized, scalable, production-ready
- **Cons**: Slow iteration, requires deployment pipeline

## üîç Redis Connection Issue Resolution

The Redis connection errors were caused by:

1. **Compiled Code**: Production build had cached connection logic
2. **Environment Mismatch**: Development Redis URL with production connection handling
3. **Fallback Logic**: Hardcoded localhost fallbacks in RSS handler

### Fixed By:

1. ‚úÖ Removing hardcoded localhost fallbacks
2. ‚úÖ Proper environment variable handling
3. ‚úÖ Consistent Docker service networking

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Current setup works for development with fixed Redis connections
2. **Short-term**: Implement proper development Dockerfiles
3. **Long-term**: Create production-ready deployment configurations
4. **Documentation**: Update README with clear development/production instructions

This strategy ensures Omnivore can be developed efficiently while maintaining production deployment capabilities for self-hosting and cloud deployment.
