# Omnivore Architecture Documentation

This directory hosts lightweight, versioned architecture notes that evolve with the Omnivore codebase. The content is organized according to the C4 model, migration roadmap, and supporting reference material that can be shared directly in Basecamp.

- [System Context](./c4-context.md)
- [System Context DSL](./c4-context.dsl)
- [System Context PlantUML](./c4-context.puml)
- [Container View](./c4-container.md)
- [API Component View](./c4-component.md)
- [API Surface Audit](./api-endpoints.md)
- [NestJS Migration Roadmap](./migration-roadmap.md)
- [Ticket Backlog](./ticket-backlog.md)

Use these documents as conversation starters; update them as services, responsibilities, or priorities shift. Each file favors pragmatic detail over exhaustive prose so the documentation can remain close to reality while we iterate.
