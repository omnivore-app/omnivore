                <p id="4d80" data-selectable-paragraph=""> I used to have a bunch of recipes up online. But writing recipes is no fun; it is difficult to capture the beauty of a dish with a bunch of steps. Moreover, using recipes isn’t how I cook. I want to understand the flavors of a dish and then execute it in my own way, in my own hands. So the recipes went away. </p>
                <p id="73f9" data-selectable-paragraph=""> But one of the most popular — and one of my personal favorites — was a recipe for the Mexican pork dish <em>carnitas</em>. It was a fun, relatively easy recipe, not traditional in approach but fairly traditional (and really delicious) in output. Folks keep asking for it. So here it is, in hopes I can eat it at your next house party. </p>
                <p id="afba" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Carnitas is a wonderful Mexican dish, pork shoulder cooked until tender and then given a great crisp. In Mexico, carnitas is eaten on its own, in tacos, or in tortas. The traditional recipe is simple: several pounds of pork shoulder, a pound or two of lard, orange peel, and some water (or coca-cola), slow roasted and then “boiled” to a crisp. That is…a bit much. What follows is not an authentic approach. </p>

                <p id="a3be" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Never ones to eschew taste for health, the French have nonetheless taught us nothing if not that we can make a succulent, flavorful dish without boiling a tough cut of meat in lard. In that vein, my recipe is more of a <em>braiser de porc</em> than a <em>confit de porc</em> — pork shoulder, aromatics, citrus juice, and a little Grand Marnier, slow cooked on the stove. Healthier for the heart, but also — more importantly — tastier to the tongue. To obtain that classic carnitas crisp, we braise the meat uncovered until the liquid evaporates and then move the pot to the oven and caramelize. </p>
                <p id="2954" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Makes about 6 servings. </p>
                <p id="b0e5" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Ingredients: </p>
                <p id="5c56" data-selectable-paragraph=""> 3 lbs <strong>boneless pork shoulder</strong>, preferably Boston butt (the upper shoulder)<br> 4 tablespoons <strong>grape seed oil</strong><br> 6 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, peeled and thinly-sliced<br> 2 <strong>oranges</strong>, juiced, plus the zest of 1/2<br> 2 <strong>limes</strong>, juiced and zested<br> several cups <strong>chicken stock</strong><br> 1 teaspoon <strong>ground cayenne pepper</strong><br> 1 tablespoon <strong>ground ancho chile</strong><br> 1 tablespoon <strong>ground chipotle pepper</strong><br> 2 teaspoons <strong>cumin</strong><br> 1 teaspoon <strong>ground cinnamon</strong><br> 1 teaspoon freshly-ground <strong>black pepper</strong><br>
                    <strong>herb sachet</strong> with 8 sprigs <strong>Mexican oregano</strong>, 6 sprigs <strong>thyme</strong>, 2 sticks <strong>cinnamon</strong>, and 2 <strong>bay leaves</strong>, wrapped in a cheese cloth and tied shut with cooking twine<br> 1 cup <strong>Grand Marnier</strong><br> coarse <strong>sea salt</strong>, to coat meat, plus more to taste
                </p>
                <p id="78f1" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Cut the pork shoulder into 5" chunks. Remove any gratuitously-excessive fat, but leave at least a thin layer. Sprinkle the chunks with sea salt. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes. Pat dry. </p>
                <p id="c35e" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Heat the grape seed oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sauté the pork shoulder until well browned on each side. If needed, sauté across multiple batches. </p>
                <p id="5c2a" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Add the garlic and sauté for one more minute. </p>
                <p id="48dd" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Add the orange zest, lime zest, ground cayenne pepper, ground ancho chile, ground chipotle chile, cumin, ground cinnamon, black pepper, and herb sachet. Mix. </p>
                <p id="c098" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Add the Grand Marnier, orange juice, and lime juice. Stir, scrapping the bottom of the pot. </p>
                <p id="88ed" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Add chicken stock as needed such that the pork is two-thirds submerged in liquid. </p>
                <p id="f490" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Stirring, raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower heat until the liquid is at a simmer and braise, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pork is cooked and tender but not disintegrating and the liquid is reduced by at least two-thirds, about three hours. If the liquid gets perilously-low while cooking, add a little chicken stock. </p>
                <p id="efa0" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Remove pork from pot. Once cool enough to handle, use a fork to shred the pork into bite-sized, but fairly large, chunks, removing any fatty pieces as desired. </p>
                <p id="3c34" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Preheat oven to 450°F. </p>
                <p id="f864" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Return pork chunks to pot. Place uncovered pot in oven. Continue cooking until the liquid has evaporated and the pork is crispy and starting to caramelize, about 20 minutes. </p>
                <p id="b38a" data-selectable-paragraph=""> Taste and adjust salt. Serve with warm corn tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, diced white onion, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, margaritas, and college football. </p>
