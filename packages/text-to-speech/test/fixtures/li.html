                - Among Wang YI’s meetings was one with Russian Foreign Minister
                Lavrov. There was nothing in the readout from the Lavrov meeting
                that would indicate a shift in the PRC position in the Russian
                invasion of Ukraine. Wang will meet US Secretary of State
                Blinken Friday.

                - Authorities are wrapping up the Sun Lijun "clique" case before
                the 20th. Today both Fu Zhenghua and Wang Like were sentenced
                death with a two year reprieve, and both releases said they had
                no possibility of parole or reduction in sentence. Sun has yet
                to be sentenced but it feels like it will happen imminently.
                Given his leadership role he should at least get life in jail,
                if not the actual death penalty, though he was promoted for
                years by people above him in the system so perhaps he performed
                “meritorious service” and ratted out other senior officials.

                - This meeting did not offer any significant economic boosts,
                among other things it reviewed reports of the inspection teams
                sent to several provinces to check on implementation of economic
                stabilization measures, promised more administrative reforms,
                and cut toll fees for freight trucks by 10% and
                government-designated cargo port charges by 20% in Q4.

                time soon, if ever. That is the outcome the policymakers have
                been targeting for years, though they may have been
                overconfident in their ability to rein in real estate without
                creating dangerous domino effects throughout the economy. We are
                all waiting for the 20th Party Congress outcomes, but I see no
                reason to think there will be outcomes from that meeting that
                reverse the trajectory of the real estate sector.

                - The trial audits of PRC firms are underway, so far the signs
                are positive that the PRC side understands the concessions
                needed to keep the PRC firms listed in the US, but as the PCAOB
                chair said today “The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
                demands complete access. The agreement we signed with our
                Chinese counterparts guarantees complete access. And the PCAOB
                will accept nothing less than complete access when we make our
                determinations by the end of this year. When I say no loopholes
                and no exceptions, I mean none.” Having a law that allows little
                room for concessions has been very helpful to US negotiators.
